These social planning neighbourhoods were developed by the City of Toronto to help government and community organizations with local planning by providing socio-economic data at a meaningful geographic area. The boundaries of these social planning neighbourhoods are consistent over time, allowing for comparison between Census years. Neighbourhood level data from a variety of other sources are also available through the City\\'s Wellbeing Toronto mapping application and here on the Open Data portal.\\n\\n \\n\\nEach data point in this file is presented for the City\\'s 140 neighbourhoods, as well as for the City of Toronto as a whole. The data is sourced from a number of Census tables released by Statistics Canada. The general Census Profile is the main source table for this data, but other Census tables have also been used to provide additional information.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor definitions of terms and concepts referenced in this data set, users should consult the reference materials produced by Statistics Canada for the 2016 Census, available online at: [http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/index-eng.cfm](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/index-eng.cfm).\\n\\n \\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: Statistics Canada does not release data at the level of Toronto\\'s social planning neighbourhoods. Neighbourhood level data for 2016 are initially calculated by summing data for the Census Tracts which comprise each neighbourhood. Statistics Canada\\'s random rounding reporting practices may have a compounded effect on the totals. These figures should be interpreted with caution where there are relatively few observations, such as for 5 year age groups by sex, or language groups with a small number of speakers. Certain values such as median values (and in some cases percentages and means) cannot yet be calculated at the neighbourhood level from available data. Where possible, these data will be updated when custom data at the neighbourhood level has been acquired from Statistics Canada.\\n', 'owner_org': '95a064ae-77e8-4ef0-a4e3-4e2d43e1f066', 'last_refreshed': '2019-10-07T18:50:50.435597', 'image_url': None, 'formats': 'XLSX,CSV,JSON,XML', 'owner_section': None, 'organization': {'description': '', 'created': '2019-07-23T15:51:35.236542', 'title': 'City of Toronto', 'name': 'city-of-toronto', 'is_organization': True, 'state': 'active', 'image_url': '', 'revision_id': '62817a72-3dc5-450a-8cc4-fef2c51660da', 'type': 'organization', 'id': '95a064ae-77e8-4ef0-a4e3-4e2d43e1f066', 'approval_status': 'approved'}, 'revision_id': '4c39060d-8bb2-49f7-9f4a-d84c0954cf31', 'civic_issues': 'Affordable housing,Poverty reduction,Mobility,Climate change'}\n"

City of Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles use this Census data to provide a portrait of the demographic, social and economic characteristics of the people and households in each City of Toronto neighbourhood. The profiles present selected highlights from the data, but these accompanying data files provide the full data set assembled for each neighbourhood.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor more information, visit the [Neighbourhood Profiles webpage.](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/neighbourhood-profiles/)\\n\\n \\n\\nIn these profiles, \"neighbourhood\" refers to the City of Toronto\\'s 140 social planning neighbourhoods. These social planning neighbourhoods were developed by the City of Toronto to help government and community organizations with local planning by providing socio-economic data at a meaningful geographic area. The boundaries of these social planning neighbourhoods are consistent over time, allowing for comparison between Census years. Neighbourhood level data from a variety of other sources are also available through the City\\'s Wellbeing Toronto mapping application and here on the Open Data portal.\\n\\n \\n\\nEach data point in this file is presented for the City\\'s 140 neighbourhoods, as well as for the City of Toronto as a whole. The data is sourced from a number of Census tables released by Statistics Canada. The general Census Profile is the main source table for this data, but other Census tables have also been used to provide additional information.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor definitions of terms and concepts referenced in this data set, users should consult the reference materials produced by Statistics Canada for the 2016 Census, available online at: [http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/index-eng.cfm](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/index-eng.cfm).\\n\\n \\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: Statistics Canada does not release data at the level of Toronto\\'s social planning neighbourhoods. Neighbourhood level data for 2016 are initially calculated by summing data for the Census Tracts which comprise each neighbourhood. Statistics Canada\\'s random rounding reporting practices may have a compounded effect on the totals. These figures should be interpreted with caution where there are relatively few observations, such as for 5 year age groups by sex, or language groups with a small number of speakers. Certain values such as median values (and in some cases percentages and means) cannot yet be calculated at the neighbourhood level from available data. Where possible, these data will be updated when custom data at the neighbourhood level has been acquired from Statistics Canada.\\n', 'owner_org': '95a064ae-77e8-4ef0-a4e3-4e2d43e1f066', 'last_refreshed': '2019-10-07T18:50:50.435597', 'image_url': None, 'formats': 'XLSX,CSV,JSON,XML', 'owner_section': None, 'organization': {'description': '', 'created': '2019-07-23T15:51:35.236542', 'title': 'City of Toronto', 'name': 'city-of-toronto', 'is_organization': True, 'state': 'active', 'image_url': '', 'revision_id': '62817a72-3dc5-450a-8cc4-fef2c51660da', 'type': 'organization', 'id': '95a064ae-77e8-4ef0-a4e3-4e2d43e1f066', 'approval_status': 'approved'}, 'revision_id': '4c39060d-8bb2-49f7-9f4a-d84c0954cf31', 'civic_issues': 'Affordable housing,Poverty reduction,Mobility,Climate change'}\n"

City of Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles use this Census data to provide a portrait of the demographic, social and economic characteristics of the people and households in each City of Toronto neighbourhood. The profiles present selected highlights from the data, but these accompanying data files provide the full data set assembled for each neighbourhood.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor more information, visit the [Neighbourhood Profiles webpage.](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/neighbourhood-profiles/)\\n\\n \\n\\nIn these profiles, \"neighbourhood\" refers to the City of Toronto\\'s 140 social planning neighbourhoods. These social planning neighbourhoods were developed by the City of Toronto to help government and community organizations with local planning by providing socio-economic data at a meaningful geographic area. The boundaries of these social planning neighbourhoods are consistent over time, allowing for comparison between Census years. Neighbourhood level data from a variety of other sources are also available through the City\\'s Wellbeing Toronto mapping application and here on the Open Data portal.\\n\\n \\n\\nEach data point in this file is presented for the City\\'s 140 neighbourhoods, as well as for the City of Toronto as a whole. The data is sourced from a number of Census tables released by Statistics Canada. The general Census Profile is the main source table for this data, but other Census tables have also been used to provide additional information.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor definitions of terms and concepts referenced in this data set, users should consult the reference materials produced by Statistics Canada for the 2016 Census, available online at: [http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/index-eng.cfm](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/index-eng.cfm).\\n\\n \\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: Statistics Canada does not release data at the level of Toronto\\'s social planning neighbourhoods. Neighbourhood level data for 2016 are initially calculated by summing data for the Census Tracts which comprise each neighbourhood. Statistics Canada\\'s random rounding reporting practices may have a compounded effect on the totals. These figures should be interpreted with caution where there are relatively few observations, such as for 5 year age groups by sex, or language groups with a small number of speakers. Certain values such as median values (and in some cases percentages and means) cannot yet be calculated at the neighbourhood level from available data. Where possible, these data will be updated when custom data at the neighbourhood level has been acquired from Statistics Canada.\\n', 'owner_org': '95a064ae-77e8-4ef0-a4e3-4e2d43e1f066', 'last_refreshed': '2019-10-07T18:50:50.435597', 'image_url': None, 'formats': 'XLSX,CSV,JSON,XML', 'owner_section': None, 'organization': {'description': '', 'created': '2019-07-23T15:51:35.236542', 'title': 'City of Toronto', 'name': 'city-of-toronto', 'is_organization': True, 'state': 'active', 'image_url': '', 'revision_id': '62817a72-3dc5-450a-8cc4-fef2c51660da', 'type': 'organization', 'id': '95a064ae-77e8-4ef0-a4e3-4e2d43e1f066', 'approval_status': 'approved'}, 'revision_id': '4c39060d-8bb2-49f7-9f4a-d84c0954cf31', 'civic_issues': 'Affordable housing,Poverty reduction,Mobility,Climate change'}\n"
